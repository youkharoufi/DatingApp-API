# Dating App

Dating App is (as stated) a dating application in which you can as a user see other people's profiles, pictures, description, age [...]. You can also chat with the users via a SignalR powered.
You can also filter your search based on : age, gender, new users [...].

## Installation
To start using the app, all you have to do is in the Package Manager Console:

```
add-migration InitialMigration
update-database
```

SqLite is mandatory in order to host the seed data users. 

This is a Backend API, meaning that it works in pair with the DatingApp-UI application which you can find in my repositories.

## Usage

You can see that there are seed users already to help you use the app without having to register with your actual email address.
If you identify as a man, login with these credentials (prepared for showing purposes) : 

```json
username:juarez
password:Pa$$w0rd
```

If you identify as a woman, login with these credentials (prepared for showing purposes) : 

```json
username:anne
password:Pa$$w0rd
```

## Rules

There are no specific rules except to enjoy :)
